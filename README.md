# Tic-Tac Neon

Tic-Tac Neon is an aesthetic take on the classic game, Tic-Tac Toe. The application was built with React in order to leverage component based development, and to enhance performance via React's virtual DOM utility. There are many possible features for future iterations of Tic-Tac Neon, so React was also chosen for its flexibility.

## Future Iterations

In the future, Tic-Tac Neon could benefit from a number of features: 
  - Implementing a back-end with OAuth or JWTs that allows a user to sign-up, and an arcade style high scores table.
  - Allowing users to scale game size from 3 x 3 to larger grids.
  - Implementing an AI feature to allow users to play vs computer with varying difficulty levels.
    - From easy to "minmax" level difficulty.
  - Incorporate sound effects for a more robust UX.
